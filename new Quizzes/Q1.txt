A hypothetical Agile project scenario:

This exercise not only assesses your understanding of Agile principles but also provides a hands-on experience in applying those principles in a simulated project environment.

Agile Principles Exercise: Building a Task Management App
Scenario:
Imagine you are part of a software development team tasked with building a Task Management App. The client wants a simple, user-friendly app that allows users to create, assign, and track tasks collaboratively. The project is set to be developed using Agile principles. Your team has just started the first sprint.

Exercise:

Task 1: User Stories (15 minutes)
Individual Activity:

Each student, as a member of the development team, is tasked with creating two user stories for the Task Management App. These user stories should capture essential functionalities or features that the app needs to have.
Encourage students to think from the user's perspective and express the user story in the "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]" format.
Group Activity:

Form small groups and have students share their user stories within their groups.
Each group should collaboratively choose the most valuable user stories and be prepared to explain their choices.
Task 2: Sprint Planning (20 minutes)
Individual Activity:

Each student, as a Scrum Master, is tasked with planning the first sprint. They need to identify the user stories chosen for the sprint, estimate the effort required for each story, and decide on the sprint duration.
Group Activity:

Students should come together in their groups to discuss and align their individual sprint plans. Emphasize the importance of collaboration and reaching a consensus on the sprint goal.

Task 3: Daily Stand-up (15 minutes)
Group Activity:
Each group conducts a simulated daily stand-up meeting. Students take turns playing the roles of team members and provide updates on their progress, mention any impediments, and discuss how they plan to move forward.

Task 4: Sprint Review and Retrospective (20 minutes)
Group Activity:
Each group conducts a simulated sprint review, presenting the completed user stories and demonstrating any working features to the "client" (instructor or another group).
Following the review, the group conducts a retrospective, discussing what went well, what could be improved, and any adjustments they would make for the next sprint.
Debrief (10 minutes)

Class Discussion:
Let's have a discussion about your experience with the exercise and how it relates to Agile principles.
Remember the key Agile concepts such as collaboration, adaptability, and continuous feedback.

Make sure "Docker Desktop Service" is running
net stop com.docker.service
net start com.docker.service

docker images
docker ps
docker ps -a
docker rm containerID
docker rmi imageid
----------------------------

docker run --rm hello-world

--rm 
Removes the anonymous volumes (file system) associated with the container when the container is removed. 
docker run hello-world
docker images
docker ps -a

========================================================================
docker login

Search for possible images
docker search nginx

Pull an image down with the command 
docker pull nginx

tag lets us edit an image and save it to our own personal registry
docker tag nginx mikebaradaran/my-nginx`

view the images saved locally 
docker images

docker push mikebaradaran/my-nginx

We can delete our local image(s)
docker rmi nginx
docker rmi mikebaradaran/my-nginx

TIP - You can type any number of chars in the image docker rmi 4
=========================================================================
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginxDemo nginx

-d : detached, logs aren't outputed to the terminal
-p : port publishing, <host port>:<container port>
--name : what you want to name the container, if no name is given a random name is given
<image name> : what image to build the container from

docker ps
http://localhost

-------------------------------------------

Exec into this container 
(docker exec -it (interactive) <container name> <shell to interact with>)
docker exec -it nginxDemo bash

Update package manager and install editor
apt update
apt install nano -y

apt update: update the package index files on the system, which contain information about available packages and their versions. It downloads the most recent package information from the sources listed in the "/etc/apt/sources.list" file that contains your sources 

cd /usr/share/nginx/html and modify it
nano index.html

Escape exec by typing 
    exit 

http://localhost/
============================

## Complex Dockerfile Instructions
Demo to show commands by running a basic Python App

mkdir python-docker` cd to it and create a python file `touch coolApp.py`

Enter the following in `coolApp.py`  (nano coolApp.py)


from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/home')
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello world!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000, host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)

npm install flask  <--

Create a Dockerfile and add the following:

# Python as a base image
FROM python:3.7
# Create and set work directory as coolApp
WORKDIR /coolApp
# Execute a pip install command to install flask
RUN pip install flask
# Copies the python file into /coolApp
COPY coolApp.py .
# Documents the por#t to use
EXPOSE 5000
# What do you want the container to do when it starts? Main process
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "coolApp.py"]


Build the image with `docker build -t coolapp .`

Tag the image with your username `docker tag coolapp <username>/coolapp

Push the image up to DockerHub with `docker push <username>/coolapp`

Run a container with `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name coolAppContainer coolapp`
http://localhost:5000
